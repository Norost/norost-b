|===

=== Allocate [[syscall_alloc]]

Allocate a region of private memory.

=== Unmap [[syscall_unmap]]

Unmap a region of memory.

=== New object [[syscall_new_object]]

Create a new object

| Type 3+| Arguments | Description

| Subrange
| handle
| start
| end
| Create a wrapper around a subrange of a memory object.

| Root
|
|
|
| Create a new root object, which holds a string-reference map to objects.

| Duplicate
| handle
|
|
| Duplicate a handle to an object.

| SharedMemory
| size
|
|
| Allocate a region of memory for sharing with other processes.

| StreamTable
| buffer base
| buffer block p2size
| allow sharing
| Create a StreamTable.

| PermissionMask
| handle
| rwx
|
| Restrict the permissions which can be used when mapping a memory object.

| Pipe
|
|
|
| Create an object to stream data in one direction.
  This call returns two objects.
  The first object serves as input and the second serves as output.

| MessagePipe
|
|
|
| Create an object to send messages in one direction.
  Unlike Pipe, messages have a clear boundary.
  Messages cannot be partially read.
  A read request must pass an appropriately sized buffer.
  This call returns two objects.
  The first object serves as input and the second serves as output.

|===

=== Map object [[syscall_map_object]]

Map a memory object.

=== Do I/O [[syscall_do_io]]

Perform a synchronous I/O operation.

|===

=== Poll I/O queue [[syscall_poll_io_queue]]

Poll an I/O queue.

=== Wait I/O queue [[syscall_wait_io_queue]]

Sleep until a response is available in an I/O queue or the timeout expires.

NOTE: This call may return early, especially on 32-bit platforms where wait time
is usually limited to 2^32^ nanoseconds.

=== Monotonic time [[syscall_monotonic_time]]

Get the current monotonic time.

NOTE: The delta corresponds to real time but the start time is arbitrary and unspecified.

=== Sleep [[syscall_sleep]]

Sleep for at least the given timeout.

=== Exit [[syscall_exit]]

Exit the process.
This terminates all threads.

=== Spawn thread [[syscall_spawn_thread]]

Create a new thread.

=== Wait thread [[syscall_wait_thread]]

Wait until a thread finishes.

=== Exit thread [[syscall_exit_thread]]

Exit from the current thread.

=== Create I/O queue [[syscall_create_io_queue]]

Create a new I/O queue.

=== Destroy I/O queue [[syscall_destroy_io_queue]]

Destroy an I/O queue.

== Virtual system calls

Certain system calls are implemented entirely in userspace to improve performance.
Currently, it only consists of a page of data that is shared system wide.

|===

=== Monotonic [[syscall_monotonic]]

Get the current system time in nanoseconds, which increments monotonically.

This call uses a shared data structure located at `0x1000`:

----
struct MonotonicInfo {
    version: u32
    pad0: u32
    tick_timestamp: u64
    system_time: u64
    tick_to_system_mul: u64
    tick_shift: s8
    flags: u8
    pad: [u8; 2]
}
----

To calculate the current time in nanoseconds, wait for the version field to be even.
Then run the following algorithm:

----
time = current_ticks() - tick_timestamp
if tick_shift >= 0 {
    time <<= tick_shift
} else {
    time >>= -tick_shift
}
time = (time * tick_to_system_mul) >> 32
time = time + system_time
----

Lastly, check if the version field changed.
If yes, rerun the algorithm when the version is even again.

NOTE: Monotonic is designed to work efficiently with `pvclock`.

[NOTE]
====
`current_ticks()` corresponds to:

* `rdtsc` on x86_64.
* `time` CSR on RISC-V.
