= Norost B Operating System

image::https://static.salt-inc.org/norost/norost-v0.2a.jpg[Rust FTW]

Norost B is an object-oriented OS built around a microkernel.
It is mainly focused on isolating processes from the rest of the system to improve
security, portability &and; scaling.

== Features

=== Object-oriented interface

Files, network sockets ... are all objects and have a common API.
This keeps the interface simple & comprehensible while providing a great amount of flexibility
and power.

Any process can create new objects.
IPC is performed via operations on objects.

Processes can only perform operations on objects they have a handle to.
This makes it trivial to isolate processes from the rest of the system by simply giving it only
handles to objects it needs.

==== Synchronous & Asynchronous I/O (completion model with shared ring queues)

Minimal applications can use the synchronous API to keep the binary small while more advanced
applications can take advantage of asynchronous I/O to more efficiently perform batch work.

Applications can also take advantage of shared memory with specialized I/O structures to further
reduce overhead.

==== Networking

Some basic support for networking is present.
A basic SSH server and HTTP server are available.

==== GUI

Applications can allocate a window and draw any arbitrary pixels to it.
The tiling window manager automatically handles layout to optimize screen estate.

==== Other

The kernel is nearly fully preemptible.

Most drivers are outside the kernel, which makes it easier to replace and/or stub them.

== Supported hardware

=== Storage

* VIRTIO block devices

=== Graphics

* VIRTIO GPU
* Intel HD Graphics (very poorly, only on specific laptops with specific boot settings)

== Building

link::thirdparty/rust[You will need a patched Rust compiler.]

Once the compiler is properly configured, `mkiso.sh` will create a bootable image.
`run.sh` will run the OS in QEMU.
