// FIXME we need to be *very* careful with globals: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2363
//
// This is a big deal due to the rustc-dep-of-std feature being necessary at the moment.
//
// This is *very* annoying since we'll have to either:
// - move global things to a crate that doesn't even use *libcore*. This isn't a practical option.
// - ensure globals point to the same objects somehow. This can be achieved with weak linking.
// The latter option has been tried with the #[linkage] attribute but Rust is being a giant PITA
// and seems inconsistent in what types it allows for weak linking. global_asm! does work for our
// needs though it is easy to misuse.
